# SoH3D — progress & state

Goal: make **Ship of Harkinian** render **OoT3D (3DS)** character models and world
geometry instead of the N64 assets. Asset-conversion + renderer-integration task
(not a renderer merge). Azahar (3DS emulator) is built as the **visual oracle**.

## Layout
- `tools/` — 3DS asset toolchain (Python, dependency-free for extraction).
- `scripts/` — dependency install scripts (Fedora; run with sudo yourself).
- `Shipwright/` — SoH fork (own git, gitignored from parent).
- `Azahar/` — 3DS emulator fork, used as oracle (own git, gitignored from parent).
- `3ds/` — boot9/boot11 (not needed for extraction; for emulator). gitignored.
- `scratch/` — extraction output, logs, screenshots. gitignored.

## Done
- ROMs verified: N64 OoT USA v1.0 (`<rom-dir>/ROM/N64/...z64`, supported hash),
  OoT3D USA decrypted NCSD (`<rom-dir>/ROM/3DS/...3ds`).
- 3DS extraction pipeline, **verified on the pot** (`zelda_tsubo`):
  - `tools/ctr_romfs.py` NCSD→NCCH→RomFS (IVFC), no bootrom needed.
  - `tools/zar.py` ZAR archives.
  - `tools/cmb.py` CMB models: geometry/skeleton/material+texture refs. OBJ export.
  - `tools/pica_texture.py` PICA textures (ETC1 + 8x8 Morton-tiled formats).
  - pot → 130 verts / 160 tris, ETC1 + RGB565 textures decode correctly.
- **SoH builds**: `Shipwright/build-cmake/soh/soh.elf` (57 MB). `soh.o2r` generated.
- Azahar configures & its externals build.

## In progress / next
- **Azahar Qt frontend build**: needs Qt6 — run `scripts/install_azahar_deps.sh`,
  then reconfigure with `-DENABLE_QT=ON` and build `citra_qt`. (Azahar has NO
  standalone SDL frontend; `citra_cli` is just a static helper lib.)
- **SoH game assets**: `GenerateSohOtr` uses `--norom` (only builds `soh.o2r`).
  The game `oot.o2r` is produced by SoH's built-in extractor at first launch
  (point it at the staged ROM `Shipwright/OTRExporter/oot_ntsc10.z64`).
- Then: oracle instrumentation in Azahar `video_core` (dump geometry/material/
  texture state + framebuffer for a target model), and the SoH-side integration
  (new 3DS-model resource + draw path, hooked where the N64 model is drawn).

## Gotchas learned (CMB; wiki is partly wrong / MM3D-mixed)
- OoT3D cmb version = 6; MM3D = 0x0A. OoT3D has NO tangent attribute.
- SEPD VertexList stride = 0x1C (includes constant vec4), not 0x14.
- VATR slice entry = (size u32, offset u32) — size FIRST.
- Bone struct stride = 0x28. PRM indices are global into VATR (start + idx*stride).
- Texture glFormat = (dataType<<16) | formatConstant.

# SoH3D — progress & state

Goal: make **Ship of Harkinian** render **OoT3D (3DS)** character models and world
geometry instead of the N64 assets. Asset-conversion + renderer-integration task
(not a renderer merge). Azahar (3DS emulator) is built as the **visual oracle**.

## Layout
- `tools/` — 3DS asset toolchain (Python, dependency-free for extraction).
- `scripts/` — dependency install scripts (Fedora; run with sudo yourself).
- `Shipwright/` — SoH fork (own git, gitignored from parent).
- `Azahar/` — 3DS emulator fork, used as oracle (own git, gitignored from parent).
- `3ds/` — boot9/boot11 (not needed for extraction; for emulator). gitignored.
- `scratch/` — extraction output, logs, screenshots. gitignored.

## Done
- ROMs verified: N64 OoT USA v1.0 (`/mnt/Boy/ROM/N64/...z64`, supported hash),
  OoT3D USA decrypted NCSD (`/mnt/Boy/ROM/3DS/...3ds`).
- 3DS extraction pipeline, **verified on the pot** (`zelda_tsubo`):
  - `tools/ctr_romfs.py` NCSD→NCCH→RomFS (IVFC), no bootrom needed.
  - `tools/zar.py` ZAR archives.
  - `tools/cmb.py` CMB models: geometry/skeleton/material+texture refs. OBJ export.
  - `tools/pica_texture.py` PICA textures (ETC1 + 8x8 Morton-tiled formats).
  - pot → 130 verts / 160 tris, ETC1 + RGB565 textures decode correctly.
- **SoH builds & RUNS**: `soh.elf` (57 MB). Game archive `oot.o2r` (33 MB) +
  `soh.o2r` generated and staged in `build-cmake/soh/`. Boots headlessly to the
  title screen, **render captured** (scratch/screenshots/soh_vanilla.png).
- **Azahar builds & RUNS OoT3D**: `azahar` (49 MB). Boots the ROM (title id
  0004000000033500), inits DSP/save archive, emulates without crashing. Run with
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME` pointed at `scratch/azahar_{cfg,data}` to keep
  it out of the user's real config. Logs to `<data>/azahar-emu/log/azahar_log.txt`.
- **Headless frame-dump tool** added to libultraship (branch `soh3d` in the
  submodule): `SOH_FRAMEDUMP=<path.ppm> SOH_FRAMEDUMP_FRAME=N ./soh.elf` under
  `xvfb-run`. Reusable for A/B vs the oracle. (exit 139 on teardown after dump is
  harmless — PPM is written before exit.)

### How to run SoH headless + capture
```
cd Shipwright/build-cmake/soh
SOH_FRAMEDUMP=/abs/out.ppm SOH_FRAMEDUMP_FRAME=500 \
  timeout 150 xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1280x720x24" ./soh.elf
```

### MILESTONE — OoT3D pot renders in-game (2026-06-15)
First OoT3D asset rendered through SoH's modern renderer, in a live scene, with
its full-res 3DS texture at the correct world transform. **Approach A** (CMB →
F3DEX2 dlist + full-res RGBA32 texture), which turned out to be the right first
step — see the corrected TMEM finding below.

Pipeline:
- `tools/cmb_to_c.py <model.cmb> <out_base>` converts a CMB to a self-contained
  C source: a `Vtx[]`, the texture decoded to RGBA32 (`pica_texture.decode`),
  and an `Gfx[]` display list with **manual** texture-load commands carrying the
  *real* pixel width (so LUS uploads it at full res — NOT through 4 KB TMEM).
  Geometry is batched <=10 tris / gSPVertex load. Generated files contain
  ROM-derived assets → **gitignored, never committed**; regenerate from the ROM.
- `soh/src/soh3d/` — `soh3d.{c,h}` (env toggles) + the generated
  `soh3d_pot_model.{c,h}`. SoH globs `src/*.c` (GLOB_RECURSE) so new files are
  picked up after a `cmake build-cmake` reconfigure.
- Hook: `ObjTsubo_Draw` (z_obj_tsubo.c) calls `SoH3D_DrawModel(play, dl, actor,
  SOH3D_POT_WORLD_SCALE)` when `SOH3D=1`.

**Draw path — must build its own matrix (root cause).** Do NOT reuse
`Gfx_DrawDListOpa` for OoT3D models: it loads the actor's inherited matrix, which
carries the N64 0.01 actor scale (`Actor_Draw` does `Matrix_Scale(actor->scale)`
before the actor's Draw). With that inherited fixed-point matrix the OoT3D dlist
renders **nothing at all** (not just wrong-sized) — verified: the identical dlist
renders fine through a fresh `MTXMODE_NEW` matrix but is invisible through the
inherited one. `SoH3D_DrawModel` (soh3d.c) builds its own
translate+rotateY+scale matrix at the actor's world pos and emits the dlist, so
SoH3D owns the transform. Calibrated world scale: **0.12** (OoT3D pot ~162 model
units -> matches the N64 pot's on-screen height; tuned via the SOH3D_SPAWNPOT
spawn comparison in Deku Tree). Generated model is baked at --scale 1.0; the
world scale lives in `SOH3D_POT_WORLD_SCALE`.

Regenerate the pot model (from the extracted CMB):
```
python3 tools/cmb_to_c.py scratch/extract/tubo2_model.cmb \
  Shipwright/soh/src/soh3d/soh3d_pot_model
```

### Headless verification path (no input scripting)
Reaching an in-game scene headlessly is solved with an env-gated auto-warp that
reuses SoH's debug Select overlay + `Select_LoadGame`:
- `SOH3D_WARP=1` — boot straight into Select, then auto-warp. Default entrance
  Kakariko Village (`SOH3D_ENTRANCE=<decimal>` to override).
- `SOH3D=1` — enable OoT3D-model rendering (the `ObjTsubo_Draw` divert).
- `SOH3D_SPAWNPOT=1` — spawn one real Obj_Tsubo beside Link (the actual
  ObjTsubo_Draw path). A/B with SOH3D=0 (N64 pot) vs SOH3D=1 (OoT3D pot) in the
  same scene. params=0 needs the dungeon keep object, so use a dungeon
  (`SOH3D_ENTRANCE=0` = Deku Tree).
Verified renders: `scratch/screenshots/final_3ds.png` (OoT3D pot via the real
ObjTsubo_Draw path, Deku Tree, calibrated size) and `full_n64.png` vs
`full_s012.png` (N64 vs OoT3D height match). Code: graph.c (boot→Select),
z_select.c (auto-warp), z_play.c + soh3d.c (spawn helper).

### CORRECTION — there is NO 4 KB TMEM limit in the LUS modern path
PROGRESS/handoff previously said approach A hits "TMEM 4 KB: pot's 64x128 tex
won't fit". **Wrong.** `Interpreter::ImportTextureRgba32` reads the texture
straight from the source pointer at the tile's full dimensions; the 4 KB assert
in `GfxDpLoadBlock` is commented out, and the code explicitly supports
manually-built DLs that set the real pixel width. This is the same path SoH's HD
texture packs use. So approach A renders full-res textures fine — it is the
correct first milestone, not just a stepping stone. Approach B (native opcode)
is only needed later if per-vertex lighting/normals fidelity demands it.

## Next phase (implementation)
1. **DONE** — First in-game OoT3D pot via approach A (see MILESTONE above).
2. **DONE** — Real `ObjTsubo_Draw` path renders the OoT3D pot at calibrated size
   (0.12), via `SoH3D_DrawModel`'s own matrix. Root cause of the earlier
   non-render documented above.
3. **Fidelity**: the pot currently draws flat-lit (white vtx color, MODULATERGBA)
   and comes out DARK in dim scenes (e.g. Deku Tree) — investigate whether
   Gfx_SetupDL_25Opa lighting treats the white vertex colors as normals; want the
   OoT3D texture at full brightness (or proper scene lighting via real normals).
   Add normals + the scene lighting (or per-vertex CMB color) for real 3DS look;
   verify V-flip / wrap modes against the texture; map materials→textures (the
   converter currently hardcodes texture index 0; fine for the 1-material pot).
4. **Azahar oracle instrumentation**: headless frame dump (glReadPixels, mirror
   of the LUS one) + draw-call dump of geometry/material/texture for A/B compare.
5. **Generalize**: drive the converter from a per-actor table / GameInteractor
   `VB_*` hooks instead of editing each actor's Draw; then a second object.

## In progress / next
- **Azahar Qt frontend build**: needs Qt6 — run `scripts/install_azahar_deps.sh`,
  then reconfigure with `-DENABLE_QT=ON` and build `citra_qt`. (Azahar has NO
  standalone SDL frontend; `citra_cli` is just a static helper lib.)
- **SoH game assets**: `GenerateSohOtr` uses `--norom` (only builds `soh.o2r`).
  The game `oot.o2r` is produced by SoH's built-in extractor at first launch
  (point it at the staged ROM `Shipwright/OTRExporter/oot_ntsc10.z64`).
- Then: oracle instrumentation in Azahar `video_core` (dump geometry/material/
  texture state + framebuffer for a target model), and the SoH-side integration
  (new 3DS-model resource + draw path, hooked where the N64 model is drawn).

## Integration design (SoH render path)

Draw path (pot example): `ObjTsubo_Draw` → `Gfx_DrawDListOpa(play, dlist)`
(`soh/src/code/z_cheap_proc.c`). That fn does:
1. `Gfx_SetupDL_25Opa` (state), 2. `gSPMatrix(..., MATRIX_NEWMTX, MODELVIEW|LOAD)`
— loads the actor's already-built world matrix, 3. `gSPDisplayList(dlist)`.
So the actor transform is on the RSP matrix stack before the dlist; any
replacement draws at the correct place for free. SoH already wraps pot draw in
GameInteractor `VB_POT_SETUP_DRAW` hooks — a clean place to divert.

Two integration layers:
- **A. CMB→F3DEX2 conversion** (no LUS changes): convert CMB to an N64 display
  list + full-res RGBA32 texture, feed to `Gfx_DrawDListOpa`. **This is what's
  implemented and verified (see MILESTONE).** The old "TMEM 4 KB limit" worry was
  wrong — LUS uploads textures at full tile size (CORRECTION above). Remaining A
  limits are s16 vertex precision and N64-style lighting, not texture size.
- **B. Native model draw path** (chosen end state): new Fast3D opcode / resource
  in libultraship that, at gfx_pc interpret time, takes the current MV+proj matrix
  and renders a native CMB mesh (full-res RGBA texture bound directly, bypassing
  TMEM) through the modern gfx backend. Hook actor draw (GameInteractor `VB_` or a
  per-object table) to emit it instead of the N64 dlist. Real 3DS quality.

Plan: implement B. First milestone — pot in-game via the native path, A/B'd
against the Azahar oracle render.

To generate the **game** archive (oot.o2r) headlessly:
`python3 OTRExporter/extract_assets.py -z build-cmake/ZAPD/ZAPD.out --non-interactive <rom>`
(run from `Shipwright/soh`-relative as the build does; do after Azahar build to
avoid CPU contention).

## Gotchas learned (CMB; wiki is partly wrong / MM3D-mixed)
- OoT3D cmb version = 6; MM3D = 0x0A. OoT3D has NO tangent attribute.
- SEPD VertexList stride = 0x1C (includes constant vec4), not 0x14.
- VATR slice entry = (size u32, offset u32) — size FIRST.
- Bone struct stride = 0x28. PRM indices are global into VATR (start + idx*stride).
- Texture glFormat = (dataType<<16) | formatConstant.
